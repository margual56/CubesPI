# CubesPI
A small project to calculate the number PI using collisions with two cubes.

## Explanation
The concept is basically copied from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE) by [3blue1brown](youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), all the credit goes to him!

## Code
The main variables are at the top of the file named "cubes_pi.pde", changing them changes the final result as explained in 3blue1brown's video.

## Execution
Download processing from the [Processing page](https://processing.org/download/) and open any of the .pde, after which you can execute the code
